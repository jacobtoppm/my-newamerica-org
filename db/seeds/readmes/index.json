With the departure of Alan Davidson, Kevin is assuming the chief leadership role at OTI&mdash;working in the public interest to promote policy and regulatory reforms to strengthen communities by supporting open communications networks, platforms, and technologies. Previously, he was director of the OTI policy team. In his new capacity, Kevin will be joining the New America Leadership Team.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newamerica.org/experts/georgia-bullen/\">Georgia Bullen</a>, georgia@opentechinstitute.org, Technology Project Manager, Open Technology Institute. As Technology Project Manager, Georgia will be assisting Kevin in managing the day-to-day operations of OTI's technology-related projects such as Measurement Lab, Commotion Wireless, data visualization projects and more. The TPM will ensure that all technology projects have what they need to achieve objectives.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newamerica.org/experts/fuzz-hogan/\">Fuzz Hogan</a>, fuzz@newamerica.org, Managing Editor. Fuzz oversees the Editorial, Events and Communications Department. In that role, he is primarily responsible for how we engage audiences in DC and beyond, supervising the EEC staff, and coordinating the work of each program's communications efforts. Editorial creates and curates widely syndicated content to support the policy goals of the programs and build the New America brand as a civic enterprise with \"journalism in its DNA.\" Events engage the most influential people in media and policy through more than 200 live events a year, including the annual conference. Communications drives our efforts to place our experts in media, and engage our core audiences directly, while also supporting the communications needs of the organization. Fuzz is a member of the Leadership Team. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>The Move and Events in October</strong></p>\r\n<p>An early advisory that the move to our fabulous new space means we can NOT host events in our current space or our new space in October. Our crack events staff is working with our many friends and partners to identify some smart spaces for us to use, so we will be able to continue our awesome events. But we wanted to give you a head&rsquo;s up, so if you're planning to put on events in October you can plan ahead!</p>\r\n<p><strong>NYC: New Events and Office Space</strong></p>\r\n<p>In NYC, we are now hosting a majority of our events at <a href=\"http://civichall.org/\">Civic Hall</a>, where New America is a founding partner. Beginning July 1, we will exclusively host events at Civic Hall or external venues, and bid a fond farewell to the Lafayette St. events space. We are also moving forward with a new office space a block from Civic Hall and are slated to complete a move-in by late July-early August. Further questions can be directed to Tyler Bugg at bugg@newamerica.org.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Welcome to our New Hires!</strong></p>\r\n<p>A warm welcome to Kim Dancy and Alison Yost!

Come hear <a href=\"http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/about-david-callahan/\">David Callahan, founder of Inside Philanthropy</a>, talk about his May 30 NYT piece,<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/opinion/sunday/who-will-watch-the-charities.html?_r=0\">Who Will Watch the Charities?</a>. David is a friend of Mark Schmitt's and a prolific writer and speaker on the world of philanthropy. He designed and built <em>Inside Philanthropy</em> (New America subscribes) to meet the challenges nonprofits routinely face in raising money, offering a more nuanced, inside understanding of funders. Please read the article in advance - it will offer a great primer for an interesting conversation. </li>\r\n<li>Tuesday, June 23 at 4pm. Proposal Writing: A Conversation with Ed and OTI. Come here Conor Williams from Education Policy and Sarah Morris from OTI talk about grant writing and how they work their way through the proposal writing process. Learn some tips on project creation, narrative writing, collaborative writing, and herding the cats. Each brings a unique perspective - Conor offers a \"I'm new to the process\" perspective and Sarah offers some \"been there/done that\" tips.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you have items of urgent importance that you would like to include in the next bi-weekly issue of READ-ME!, please send them to Terry Murphy at murphy@newamerica.org. </p>\r\n<p>Best,</p>\r\n<p><strong>AM</strong></p>"

        "html": "<p>Dear All,</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/\"><strong>my.newamerica.org</strong></a><strong> and our Move FAQ</strong></p>\r\n<p>We have a new Intranet: <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/\">my.newamerica.org</a>! Any user with a valid New America or OTI Google account can log in. No separate Intranet password is required. My New America includes an <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/faq\">FAQ</a> section about our move to 740 15th Street. This page includes a move calendar, important information about what you need to be doing to prepare for the move, and it answers many common questions about what's going on. My New America also includes the following features:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quick links to ADP, Salesforce, and Jazz on its homepage.</li>\r\n<li>Searchable <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/staff-directory\">Staff Directory</a></li>\r\n<li>Archives of <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/weekly-wins\">Weekly Wins</a> and <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/readmes\">Read-Me</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/floorplans\">Floor plans</a> of our new DC office space.</li>\r\n<li>Development, IT, Finance, TDM, and Payroll &amp; Taxes <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/resources\">resources</a>, as well as general New America policies and organizational information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Reserving Rooms in the New Office Space</strong></p>\r\n<p>Conference rooms in our new office space at 740 15th Street can now be reserved on Google Calendar. When creating an event, select \"Rooms, etc\" on the right of the Google Calendar screen. Rooms are organized into folders for the 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th floors. Each available conference room is labeled as follows: </p>\r\n<p>Floor Number - Room Size - Location</p>\r\n<p>e.g. 10-Medium-Southeast</p>\r\n<p>The Intranet's <a href=\"http://my.newamerica.org/floorplans\">Floor Plans page</a> shows where each conference room is located at 740 15th Street.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PTO Accruals</strong></p>\r\n<p>It has come to TDM&rsquo;s attention that the PTO accruals in ADP for a small number of employees were not accurate. TDM has reviewed everyone's balances and will be reaching out to those affected by the end of the week. <strong>(The balances of affected employees have been updated in ADP as of 9/25/2015.) </strong><em>There is no need for alarm&mdash;we have ensured that everyone&rsquo;s balances are completely right and adjusted any that are not.</em> Please also keep in mind that you do not have to wait to accrue PTO before you use it. As a reminder, employees in their first year of employment have 4 weeks of PTO. Employees beyond their first year with NA have 6 weeks of PTO.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recording your Wins</strong></p>\r\n<p>We're switching to a new system for recording and analyzing our 'impact' -- and we need everyone's help. Whenever your work has some kind of impact -- whether it has influenced policy or legislation, generated media coverage, been cited in research or a book, or appeared in a prominent social media feed -- submit your 'win' to <strong>wins@newamerica.org</strong>. This is the new 'presshits' inbox. It's the single feed from which we'll compile <strong>Weekly Wins</strong>, add content to <strong>In The News </strong>on our website, and store long-term records on <strong>Salesforce</strong>. When you're submitting your wins, please also remember, whenever possible, to include a 1-2 sentence <strong>description</strong>. It should be written exactly how you'd like to see your win recorded in Weekly Wins. For example: &ldquo;John Smith's policy paper, \"My Policy Paper\", was quoted in The New York Times on the impact of the GOP primaries on dairy farms in Nebraska.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>TV Monitors</strong></p>\r\n<p>As you know, the big move is coming up on November 2. Unfortunately, the AV vendor will be moving all the big TV monitors in each of the conference rooms during the week of October 5. As a work-around, IT will be setting up large monitors and PCs within each conference room. Phones will still be intact until October 28. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact techsupport@newamerica.org.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Welcome to our New Hires!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hello to our New Hires!
