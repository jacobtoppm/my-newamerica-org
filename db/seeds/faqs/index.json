This means that staff must be doing the following starting now to prepare for the move:**\n\n1) Purging file cabinets, desks and bookcases of their contents. Decide what you’ll be moving to the new office - only what you actually use (movers will provide crates), what you want to take home (see Mark Hairston for boxes), and what will be recycled/trashed/shredded.\n\n2) Notify all your personal contacts of our new address and effective date. Communications will be working with departments and programs to develop a comprehensive New America mailing list and official notifications.",
